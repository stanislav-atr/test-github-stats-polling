Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List includes Dandelion Sprout's Website Stretcher, which is a very opnionated list that alters the look of many websites. Most narrow webpages are narrow because it's easier to read, not because \"[many websites still think that everyone are using narrow monitors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/Dandelion%20Sprout's%20Website%20Stretcher.txt)\". This list shouldn't be embedded in a annoyance filter in the first place. However, if it has to, the description should warn the user that the filter alters websites' looks and may break them.\r\n\r\n2.

site where you vote for a bot daily and receive certain perks or benefits from it on discord while playing the game that that bot offers. AdGuard used to be phenomenal in blocking out those ads and allowing me to skip straight to voting, but now I have to wait for an ad that doesn't even show up to end before I can vote and move on. It is time consuming and more than a little annoying, particularly annoying that ads were implemented in the first place when all users want to do is show support for the bots they like.\r\n\r\n###
