Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List includes Dandelion Sprout's Website Stretcher, which is a very opnionated list that alters the look of many websites. Most narrow webpages are narrow because it's easier to read, not because \"[many websites still think that everyone are using narrow monitors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/Dandelion%20Sprout's%20Website%20Stretcher.txt)\". This list shouldn't be embedded in a annoyance filter in the first place. However, if it has to, the description should warn the user that the filter alters websites' looks and may break them.\r\n\r\n2.

site where you vote for a bot daily and receive certain perks or benefits from it on discord while playing the game that that bot offers. AdGuard used to be phenomenal in blocking out those ads and allowing me to skip straight to voting, but now I have to wait for an ad that doesn't even show up to end before I can vote and move on. It is time consuming and more than a little annoying, particularly annoying that ads were implemented in the first place when all users want to do is show support for the bots they like.\r\n\r\n###

This device doesn't allow screenshots (why you require them for every device is beyond me). I can take photos using another device and send them to devteam if you need them.\n> Anyway, quora.com used to be HTTPS filtered just fine... now when I open it on any of my browsers that support HTTPS filtering on this device (Android 5.1.1) it is no longer filtered. It simply opens as if HTTPS filtering was disabled while all other websites filter properly.

Comment\r\nUsername: @antoine1293\r\n> When Adguard is turned on with my current setting, it blocks me from signing in to AWS management console ( aws.amazon.com) this happens both in Google Chrome and Safari and i am able to access my AWS account normally on any other devices. \r\n> I can see that AWS allows me to log in, however within seconds it will log me out and send me back to the login screen. \r\n> from looking at the network development tool in google chrome it looks as if AWS is trying to authenticate it sends an authentication request, but then adguard seems to kick in and interrupt some requests (I'm not sure exactly what they were doing) which seems to trigger AWS to redirect me to the login screen to reenter my details. \r\n> I believe it could have something to do with the way that AWS redirects users after logging in (first from signin.aws.amazon.com, then to the individual subdomain represented by the availability zone associated with the account. \r\n> Note the screenshots are not very useful as they do not show the real error which is the login issue, and i cannot send screenshots of google chrome's network developer tools without sharing personal details related to logging in \r\n> Also worth clarifying that the link where this issue occurred is individually generated for every login, however, the button to access the AWS login page, where this issue occurs, can be accessed on https://aws.amazon.com/ by clicking the \"Sign in to console\" button\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n

필요한데 사용하시는 웹 브라우저에서 우클릭 후 웹 사이트 저장을 통해 추가 정보를 업로드해주시면 감사하겠습니다.\r\n\r\n개인정보가 포함된 경우 Thunderbird 등의 메일 암호화 서비스를 통하여 아래의 지원 이메일 주소 중 하나로 암호화된 메일을 전송해주십시오.\r\n\r\n-

발생할 수 있음을 인지하고 있습니다.\r\n성능 문제는 광고 차단기의 나무위키의 DOM을 검사하는 과정에서 패턴을 인식하는데에 과도한 리소스가 사용되어 발생하는 것입니다.\r\n이는 장기적인 목표로 해결되어야 하지만 단기적으로 빠른 차단을 위해 발생할 수 있습니다.\r\n성능 문제로 인해 불편을 감수하시는 경우 현재 레포지토리의 최근 커밋 목록을 참조하여 필터 규칙을 따로 비활성화할 수 있도록 하십시오.\r\n\r\n규칙을 비활성화하려면 `namu.wiki#@#`로 시작하는 규칙을 사용자 규칙에 추가하면 됩니다.\r\n\r\n### 직접 광고를 차단하기\r\n\r\n이 때에는 직접 광고를 차단하실 수 있도록 사용하시는 광고 차단기에서 **직접 웹 사이트의 요소 차단** 기능을 이용하시는 것이 권장됩니다.\r\n\r\n> 단, 현재 방식으로 생성된 규칙을 저장소에 전송하지 마세요. 나무위키의 구조는 무작위로 변경되는 특성이 있어 다른 사람에게 적용되지 않거나 너무 많이 업데이트해야 할 수도 있습니다.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @seia-soto in
